            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p>An Electromechanical Contracting company focusing mainly in the Design, Supply
                and Installation of Automatic Firefighting Suppression Systems, Fire Detection Alarm
                Systems and Maintenance Services, located at 325 Narvaez St., San Agustin 1, Dasmariñas
                City, Cavite. Since inception, ALGON has steadfastly become one of the major players in the
                industry within CALABARZON Region.</p>
            <p>Previously, it is a sole proprietorship company formerly known ALGON ENTERPRISES,
                which was established in April 04, 2001 under the ownership and management of MR.
                EDUARDO L. ALVARAN and originally, a technical support of a fire protection supplier in
                Cavite and served several general contractors in their Automatic Fire Suppression
                Requirements of its projects. Due to the increasing demand of our services/supplies to
                businesses, the company came up with a very timely and ambitious decision, this is to
                extricate from being just a technical support and be recognized in services/supplies
                provision identified in the corporate industry.</p>
            <p>Composed with the same qualified and competitive technical team, still headed by
                MR. EDUARDO L. ALVARAN - President/Chief Operating Officer, the rebirth of ALGON FIRETECH CORPORATION
                took the spot in the industry. The company went several
                stages and procedures which finally led to be recognized by Security and Exchange
                Commission last June 11, 2019.</p>
            <p>As ALGON FIRETECH CORPORATION emerged in the business industry, it was the
                only company in the Philippines granted with an Exclusive Distributorship of TNA FIRE
                ALARM SYSTEMS manufactured by TANDA TECHNOLOGIES PTE. LTD. SINGAPORE with
                head office at TANDA UK LTD. United Kingdom. These products are U/L (Underwriters
