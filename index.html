        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>An Electromechanical Contracting company focusing mainly in the Design, Supply
            and Installation of Automatic Firefighting Suppression Systems, Fire Detection Alarm
            Systems and Maintenance Services, located at 325 Narvaez St., San Agustin 1, Dasmari√±as
            City, Cavite. Since inception, ALGON has steadfastly become one of the major players in the
            industry within CALABARZON Region.</p>
        <p>Previously, it is a sole proprietorship company formerly known ALGON ENTERPRISES,
            which was established in April 04, 2001 under the ownership and management of MR.
            EDUARDO L. ALVARAN and originally, a technical support of a fire protection supplier in
            Cavite and served several general contractors in their Automatic Fire Suppression
            Requirements of its projects. Due to the increasing demand of our services/supplies to
            businesses, the company came up with a very timely and ambitious decision, this is to
            extricate from being just a technical support and be recognized in services/supplies
            provision identified in the corporate industry.</p>
        <p>Composed with the same qualified and competitive technical team, still headed by
            MR. EDUARDO L. ALVARAN - President/Chief Operating Officer, the rebirth of ALGON FIRETECH CORPORATION
            took the spot in the industry. The company went several
            stages and procedures which finally led to be recognized by Security and Exchange
            Commission last June 11, 2019.</p>
        <p>As ALGON FIRETECH CORPORATION emerged in the business industry, it was the
            only company in the Philippines granted with an Exclusive Distributorship of TNA FIRE
            ALARM SYSTEMS manufactured by TANDA TECHNOLOGIES PTE. LTD. SINGAPORE with
            head office at TANDA UK LTD. United Kingdom. These products are U/L (Underwriters
